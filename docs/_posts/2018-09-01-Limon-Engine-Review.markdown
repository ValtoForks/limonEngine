I released the 0.5 at the beginning of August. This release is important because it is the first time Limon can be used to build a game. It adds GUI, sound and extensibility. With graphics and I/O already present, you have all the basics needed. It doesn't mean the engine has reached some sort of maturity, the goal for 1.0 is supporting first person shooters, and we have still work to do for that.

Considering these, I am surprised to see game from scratch reviewed Limon and shared a video on it. I am truly thankful for the kind words, and happy to share it.
